That's what I love about this movie, it takes you to a wild journey where anything can happen. The movie has a lot of surprises, a great villain and a good story even if I wasn't a big fan of the jokes that the movie throws at you every time anything happens.In conclusion, this is the kind of movie that you will enjoy if you watch it to have fun. This movie is far from a masterpiece, but at the same time, feels like they finally portrayed the craziness of the comics in the big screen without the fear that it could be too much for the audience.

And finally upgrading the master of Kung fu to a high-tier hero in the same level as Hulk and Thor is the best change for that character! I cannot wait for Shaun to interact in with the others heroes and his involvement in the next Avengers and others movies.

The story, in my opinion, wasn't as good as it usually is with Marvel. Not that Marvel has any masterful storylines, but it just wasn't as good in my opinion as some of the other movies that have come out from the studio in the past. What was more than good, on the other hand, was the music in places. But what was without a doubt the best and what Marvel has always been able to do and probably always will be able to do is action. The action scenes here are awesome, although then they are not very frequent. There are a few times when the pace slows down and we wait for some of the fights. Once it does though, you're in for an epic CGI load of fighting that I devoured. There's still the occasional quirk thrown in here and there, as is usually the case with Marvel movies. To sum it up. For me, a good movie that I recommend, and classically to Marvel fans. "

Además, el final quizás es demasiado grandioso para ser la película introductoria.· Conclusión: lo dicho, es una película súuuper cuidada, en todo momento, supuestamente era la ""menor"" de las 3 que iban a salir este año (Spider-Man y Eternos) pero se ha convertido en una de las grandes películas de Marvel Studios, me atrevería a decir, que es de las mejores de introducción de personajes.

Wenwu was an amazing villain as you can really feel how much he wants to see his wife back and sort of sympathize with him. Awkwafina was also really good in this movie as she is in most movies she is in. The action and drama were all top notch and so were the characters. All of the main cast members were good and overall nothing in the movie was bad. They also played Hotel California a couple of time so that's a plus lol. "

Also it corrects one of the mayor disappointments from a previous movie with a satisfying explanation and turns it into a strength. Lets start at theIt has well choreographed fights, lovable characters and a good story garnered with humor. Also it corrects one of the mayor disappointments from a previous movie with a satisfying explanation and turns it into a strength. Lets start at the beginning. Since Marvel phase 4 started you hear a lot of people say that the movies are in or will decline. This movie is the counter argument. It is refreshing, entertaining and introduces new characters I want to see more of. It was also the kind of martial arts movie my friends and I missed in recent years. The story starts with a flashback thousand (or thousands?) years ago where Wenwu finds the ten rings which gave him eternal youth and so much power that he can be considered to be a god among humans. He creates the ten rings organization and becomes a really powerful ruler but operates mostly in the shadows. However his hunger for power is never satisfied. After he hears the legend of the hidden village Ta Lo where the inhabitants have mystical power he is determined to acquire this power for himself. However he will get something different and far more precious than he could have imagined. In the present Shaun works with his best friend Kathy as car valets when their lives are changed forever. I stop here with the story set up to avoid spoilers. The story itself is extremely good for an introduction movie. It gets the small and big things right. Main key elements are family, heritage, loss, finding your way or purpose in life and dealing with the past. They manage to mix the story with the characters in a way that one enhance the other. Lets continue with the characters: Simu Liu as Shaun is a great main actor. He delivers every aspect of his character and should be praised. Then we have Awkwafina as Kathy who steals the show in many scenes and is jut amazingly good. Those two together are a force to be recognized. Tony Leug is a legendary actor and his performance as Xu Wenwu is excellent. This is also valid for Michelle Yeoh. Ben Kingsley is the hidden gem of the movie and so enjoyable. Meng’er Zhang as Xu Xialing and Fala Chen as Ying Li deliver a good performance and won us easily over. Special praise to the right hand men Ronny Chieng as Jon Jon and Florian Munteanu as Razor Fist. I almost forgot Benedict Wong. Small screentime but amazing performance. The cast is fantastic and I wont replace anyone. The fights are amazing too. The first one alone should win you over with ease. The choreography is excellent and the camera works well to enhanced it while avoiding all the mistakes other movies make. Many modern movies fail with shaky camera, poor zooming (to close, bad angles, to far away or bad lighting) and uninspired ideas. Here they shine in many fights. The special effects are excellent as required per Marvel standard. Was and is never and issue. The sets and practical effects look beautiful and create an immersive atmosphere. Lastly I want to praise the humor. There are a lot of good scenes and especially a post credit scene is a must watch. Overall this was much better than expected and I heard good things about the movie before watching it. It slightly misses a 10/10 for me but is definitely a must see. "

While the trailer appeared to bill this as little more than a grandiose martial arts movie, director Destin Daniel Cretton's latest has an epic quality about it, presenting a story that's mythic in nature and infused with themes related to morality, personal evolution and coming into one's own, qualities not often found in releases like this. The picture is essentially an origin story piece in the same vein as ""Captain Marvel"" and ""Black Panther,"" with a narrative that mirrors both of these cinematic predecessors but with better overall execution, especially in the writing and pacing. Besides its captivating story and well-orchestrated (though generally not overdone) action sequences, this offering features ample comic relief, unexpected touches of whimsy and surprisingly good performances, especially from Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh and Ben Kingsley. While the film's closing act is admittedly a little too drawn out, that's a small price to pay for everything else it has to offer. ""Shang-chi"" is easily one of the best films of the summer season and one of the finest additions to the Marvel Universe to come along in quite some time.

59,OlilovesMovies,"Sep  4, 2021",32,9,"Honestly, I was concerned going into this film, as someone who has adored the marvel cinematic universe up to this point, I didn’t know how they would be able to pull off a new phase with so many new IP’s coming into play and so many of the beloved favourites being finished with. After the relatively underwhelming Black Widow, and trailers that didn’t do anything to get me excited, I went into SCatLotTR (good lord that’s a long title..) with reservations, however, I’m delighted to say, they were absolutely unnecessary, Shang Chi is an absolute blast, and delivers so much more than the trailer led on.With genuinely likeable characters, solid visuals, an excellent soundtrack and a plot that, though familiar, is delivered in such a way as to never leave the audience bored or underwhelmed, the film had me captivated from start to finish. Though I don’t intend to spoil major plot points, I will say, the Kaiju-like finale was unexpected but a genuine spectacle! This in honestly one of the strongest Marvel origin story films yet, up there with Iron Man and Spider-Man Homecoming. Go see it and keep supporting cinema! "

It is the first MCU theatrical release with a predominantly Asian cast. While it surely fitsThe Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to expand and become more diverse with this weekend's release of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. It is the first MCU theatrical release with a predominantly Asian cast. While it surely fits into the overall expanded universe, I can't tell you how it fits into whatever phase this is, but it is essentially Shang-Chi's origin story and, in that sense, it kind of can stand alone. The question is whether its worth trekking to the theater for all the action and drama - here's how we see it.Shang-Chi also known as ""Shaun"" (Simu Liu) has been an unassuming valet for years paling around with his best friend, Katy (Awkwafina) in San Francisco. On one fateful day as Shang-Chi and Katy are on their way to work, they get attacked by a group of thugs from the Ten Rings led by the goon, Razor Fist. Shang-Chi fends off the attackers in an impressive action sequence, but he exposes what he had otherwise hidden from Katy - kung-fu prowess and a history connected to those men that attacked him. From there, Shang-Chi and Katy set out on a quest to confront his past, protect his sister, and defeat his diabolical father who has had overwhelming power for a thousand years thanks to the titular Ten Rings.For most of these MCU films, what are we really looking for? Action. Comedy. Spectacle. A tie-in to the expanded universe. Shang-Chi delivers on most of that.Action - as a newcomer to the MCU, Simu Liu does a good job of setting up who Shang-Chi is and how he might fit into the larger group. The early fight sequences are exciting primarily because of Liu's athletic abilities. The kinetic energy brought to those set pieces are good enough to jolt some awake. Also, there is a fight between Tony Leung and Fala Chen early on that is a must see - it is quite awe-inspiring. When it comes to the MCU, the climactic battles are usually a mish-mosh and over-the-top, fortunately, this one is no different.Comedy - Liu also has good chemistry with Awkwafina - although the comedy is a bit lacking considering Awkwafina's reputation. There were not really any laugh out loud moments, but the easy tone of the film overall makes it generally enjoyable. It feels like they were trying for it, but it didn't hit the mark.Spectacle - the special effects here are pretty good. The power of the Ten Rings is interesting and the way they work into the action sequences works really well. The production design of Ta Lo is really beautiful to look at. Of course, Marvel Studios used their Marvel money to make the setting stand out. I can't say it is Black Panther impressive, but it was good nonetheless.In some ways, the movie gets a bit too stereotypical with Asian folks and dragons and never aging and then turning into dragons. There also is a tinge of this movie hearkening too close to Mulan in look and feel as if Disney was like we have some content we can save money on for this. Either way, I'm glad that Disney has opened minds to diversity with their live action films. Let's keep it up!Long story short, Marvel doesn't really make missteps and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is no different. The movie is a bit too long and Simu Liu might not have found his comedic legs yet. And still the movie is stereotypically enjoyable and well done by the MCU. I wonder how this will fit into the next phases of Marvel but until then I'll pick up a big box of popcorn as I ponder. "

He plays the son of a man with mighty powers, thanks to the titular bracelets. As his father prepares for a gargantuan task, he brings his son and daughter back to their home. Since this is an origin story, there are flashbacks that reveal more about their relationships.  So much for plot. What we really care about is the action and this features some of the most beautifully choreographed fight sequences in the genre, primarily because of the focus on traditional martial arts techniques. The scenes on the bus and the skyscraper scaffolding are the highlights. Only the final dragon confrontation resorts to the typical CGI encounters. The other crucial aspect to making a superhero flick stand out is creating cool new visual approaches and there are several scenes that thrill the imagination. There’s also a sprinkling of humor, thanks primarily to the sidekick played by Awkwafina. The most enjoyable superhero movie since Black Panther. OF COURSE, stay thru the closing titles for one scene and thru ALL the credits for a final setup. "

An exemplar with which we were not familiar that, not only knew how to exploit their low expectations to the maximum extent, but also developed a structured and dynamic narrative immersed in a MCUShang-Chi is a movie that nobody expected. An exemplar with which we were not familiar that, not only knew how to exploit their low expectations to the maximum extent, but also developed a structured and dynamic narrative immersed in a MCU that does not leave much room for new heroes.Shang-Chi made its first appearance in Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin's “Special Marvel Edition # 15” (December 1973). A Kung-Fu master created in the middle of the genre's boom in the US in the 1970s, Shang-Chi is quite a quirky character.Played by Simu Liu, the protagonist is embarked on an adventure after being intercepted by ghosts from his past. Full of action, martial arts and a very own and attractive aesthetic, the film unfolds without delay. The scenes are punctual and always add something new. Even with a sense of  humor that can get heavy on certain occasions (such as when Katy makes jokes in the middle of life and death situations), Shang-Chi finds its essence, exploits it and ends with a gold ribbon leaving the door open for future aftermath.Marvel and its production team never cease to amaze me with their new films. In a difficult transition period, given the conclusion of the Infinity Saga and the beginning of this new phase, the studio keeps its feet on the ground and continues a coherent thread of its interconnected universe. Regardless of the obvious mentions to the events of ""Avengers Endgame"", Marvel returns to do what it does best: including thousands of references, cameos and winks that leave the geeks like me open-mouthed and with the greed for more.The cast is incredible. I did not know any of the actors beforehand and they all dazzled me with their distinctive personalities and professional interpretations. The studio made a great work in synthetizing the oriental culture´s mythology and beliefs. However, it is true that Shang-Chi continues to be a westernized vision of Asian cultures due to its falls into stereotypes of martial arts and frequent characterizations of the Eastern world in Hollywood. Despite this and to my surprise, Shang-Chi knows how to combine the best of both worlds, using humor as its best tool and taking its time to tell the story, avoiding the rush to get to the action sequences that movies of this kind have sufferedThe protagonist's arc is round and fulfilling. It has cohesion and is true to its ideals from beginning to end. Thus, the villain (excellently played by Tony Leung) only contributes to the plot and does not fall into the corner of un-memorable Marvel villains. We send you a greeting, Fake Mandarin. If it hadn't been for the blessing acting skills of RDJ, no one would remember your existence.Furthermore, the film interprets the concept of ""grays"" very well. In a franchise that is ""infantilized"" at times, Shang-Chi does not stutter in telling the hard truths of reality such as unsatisfactory employment, unreal family expectations, childhood trauma, the dilemma about murder, among others. Heroes are not pure white. They have their shortcomings, they fight with their demons and that makes them more credible, more human.With a stellar sound-track, Shang-Chi is one of Marvel's most unexpected gems. It is amazing to feel and denote the love with which these films are made and the fidelity to the source materials. For example, the main character's leitmotif is a work of art and a composition that immerses us even more in the plot. Kevin Feige deserves all the praise, he is truly a man who knows how to sell his product very well and, at the same time, sell us something with great qualitative value.After the post-credits scenes, fans only crave more and rejoice in the near future for what remains of this phase. Now with the recent release of the trailer for the new Spiderman movie, one only has to cross out the days for its premiere and admire the attention to detail that they put into the making of the films, not only as individual creations, but as a large adjoining and a special set of films. Bravo Marvel.Postscript: I really love Benedict Wong. Is he the ultimate man? "

Combine that with the new shows and I wonder if they're starting to get too saturated. This film and one medium flaw and a handful of small flaws in my opinion, but nothing major. The medium flaw was a character's motive three quarters into the film and some of the smaller issues was overreliance and sometimes questionable CGI (reminded me of Black Panther's not so good CGI in parts). Also, it was pretty predictable if you've seen a ton of movies over your lifetime, but again, it's a superhero flick. It dragged a smidge in Act 3 as well. On the positives, it didn't rely on a bunch of clichés in addition to the action/martial arts being top notch. The characters were likeable and world building was solid.

Guided to craft beautifully by Destin Daniel Cretton. Shang-Chi has a massive soulfulness that future MCU movies need to take notes on and that only Black Panther did so memorably. It occurred to me while watching this movie that it is genuinely no longer about the characters we focus on, but it is their adventure toward locating themselves, and we follow that adventure here in an amazing Superhero Oriental Fantasy blockbuster. Noticeably, the VFX, scene sets, costume designs, and the special effects themselves incredibly heightened the impact of the movie and allowed a symbolic impact on the awe-inspiring production value and, as a result, the aforementioned movie knocked out in dazzling heights on a beautiful scale because of the VFX. The movement sequences and choreography are polished and stunning. Narratively, the storyline continues incredibly, and we understand the moments of humour the MCU is so well-known for, and we are all here for it. This film divided me going to the cinema and waiting for a digital component! Because of COVID-19, however, I didn’t need to have the entirety of Shang-Chi spoiled earlier on with leaks, thank goodness I went to the very first showing on the opening Thursday night, I have experienced Shang-Chi several times now and in extraordinarily different formats including 4D-X. This movie displays some of the most remarkably phenomenal combat performances in a Marvel movie I had never seen in this noticeable approach previously. The movie is formulaic and well-trodden territory for Marvel and has several exceptional visual effects layered in. Shang-Chi is such an enchanting movie to watch and even better on the biggest screen you can find, keeping safety in mind at all times! If you have seen Marvel movies consistently, you’ve got to know that the narrative is a predictable storyline for Marvel’s superhero foundation adventures. This film is full of numerous great moments, with its battle sequences and action set pieces, which is arguably undoubtedly its major attraction. But Shang-Chi has given us some outstanding personalities and characters in a live-action film like Black Panther’s did so on his solitary quest. Marvel Studios’ Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the most exceptional superhero movies I’ve watched in years, if not in the past decade. Simu Liu and Meng’er Zhang and Tony Leung Chiu Wai get considerable distinct and exceptional choreographed action choreography that we have not witnessed since Captain America: Winter Soldier. There is not any one thing like Shang-Chi I have seen before in the MCU, this film seems fresh. Shang-Chi feeds us with the deprived traditional antique sequences of martial craftsmanship, which we appreciate a lot as an audience and applauds in an incredible modern depiction. This is one of the better, exceptional Marvel films ever. I would recommend watching this one. "

One thing that I have not endured instead is that they have wasted the character of ..... guys I really don't know what it's called forgive me(the masked one like taskmaster) "

His motives can be relatable, I get that, but the actual villain of the movie is quite generic.What I can give kudos to this movie is that they managed to stay away from shoehorning other MARVEL heroes and rely on them to promote this movie or be a partial reason to see it (SpiderMan Homecoming as an example). Martial arts parts are great! But then....they are turned into CGI-fight. Movie needed more martial arts and less specticle. I feel like there are a bit too many characters here...and not enough time for all. Second half is a bit...well, more MARVEL and less Shang-Chi / Martial arts. That is a bummer, i wish i saw more action and less CGI.But it was enjoyable, jokes worked and definitely looking forward to more. "

InI once said after watching Black Panther, that it would be cool if there was an all Asian cast similar to it. There were some all Asian cast movies like Crazy Rich Asian (2018), but that is a romcom, and Mulan (2020), but that was bad. In comes Shang Chi which is the first Asian lead Superhero movie ever. Firstly, the action sequences and choreography are some of the best from Marvel since Captain America and the Winter Soldier (2014). Martial arts are the focus of the action scenes in Shang Chi and they are beautifully choreographed. We get the classic wire-fu/floating style of Crouching Tiger but we also get some Jackie Chan style with the utilization of the environment for the action. Each action scene is memorable and stunning to watch. Additionally, the action scenes avoid using lots of cuts and shaky cam which I was so grateful for. It is also clear that the actors themselves rehearsed the choreography making the fights feel more believable and gratifying. It does become a more typical MCU action sequence by the third act but even that is still pretty enjoyable even if it isn't as good as the first two acts. The cinematography by Bill Pope (Matrix trilogy, Spiderman 2 and 3, Scott Pilgrim) is also excellent in Shang Chi. Skyscrapers and forests in Marvel movies have never looked as good as it has in Shang Chi. Bill pope and director Destin use the lighting and colours very effectively and allow for some genuinely beautiful shots. The music score by Joel P. West is also pretty good. Joel utilizes more electronic sounds and pop/rap songs for the scenes in the city but uses more traditional Asian instruments for the mystical areas. Joel's score captures the scene and the pop/rap songs themselves are also quite good albeit not as memorable as the Weeknd or Lamar from Black Panther. I also love the story and exploration of ""family"" with Shang Chi whilst not using Asian stereotypes. It also doesn't overuse humour like in Marvel's previous outing, Black Widow (2021), where they use jokes every couple of minutes and ruin a serious scene. Shang Chi thankfully avoids doing this, thus allowing the emotion of a scene to linger longer. There are still jokes though but they are genuinely quite funny.Furthermore, Simu Liu is charismatic, charming and cool as the titular character Shang Chi. I think Marvel succeeds again in the casting department as Simu Liu delivers on making me believe that this guy is a top tier martial artist. I also think Simu gives a good performance during the more emotional moments as well. His chemistry with Awkwafina who plays Shang Chi's friend Katy is great too. The banter between Shang Chi and Katy is some of the funniest scenes and makes me believe that those two were friends for years. However, Tony Leung who plays the main villain Wenwu (the real Mandarin) is the one that steals the show. Tony Leung is just phenomenal as he can convey the exact emotions of his character just through body language alone, it is just masterful acting. My biggest worry with MCU origin movies is that the villains are lacklustre but Shang Chi does not fall into this. Wenwu is very sympathetic but also extremely fearsome. He is also the father of Shang Chi which makes the conflict between them feel more meaningful and tragic. Wenwu is not a straight-up evil person as he does still have good in him and I like that.Unfortunately, Shang Chi suffers from having the 3 villain problem. Razorfist played by Florian is Wenwu's henchman and he doesn't get any backstory. I don't mind him that much though as he is mostly there to chase Shang Chi like a 007 henchman. There is also a scene where he does seem visibly worried about Wenwu's health which gives him some character depth. On the other hand, the 3rd villain Death Dealer who is a mysterious assassin of Wenwu is a massive disappointment. He looks very cool and visibly distinct from other ten ring members and is relevant to Shang Chi's past but amounts to absolutely nothing. Moreover, there is also a 3rd hero to Shang Chi and Katy with Shang Chi's sister Xialing played by Meng'er Zhang. She doesn't get enough interactions with Shang Chi, Katy or her father Wenwu and that feels like a waste. It's a shame as her interactions with both Shang Chi and Katy are enjoyable and she also doesn't interact with her dad Wenwu which is just a missed opportunity for her character. The movie also has a pacing issue as it slows down significantly in the second act. It just featured a lot of talking, exposition and flashbacks which I felt could have been cut down by a couple of minutes.Overall, Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the all Asian cast movie I have been waiting for. It delivers on the action, story and characters while being an exciting new addition to the MCU. I can't wait to see more of Shang Chi and finally get to see an Asian in the Avengers team. "

Welp, they better get that idea off the table ASAP, because this movie is not only doing amazingly well, it's also an amazing movie! “Shang-Chi” is a unique genre blend of martial arts, fantasy, and family drama.In my opinion, this film had quite possibly, some of the best fights in any Marvel movie. The film had everything you could possibly want in a martial arts film: From elegant ""Wire fu"" fights to traditional martial arts to feudal battles, it was a true celebration of Asian martial arts.Coupled with amazing martial arts, this film also had a fun fantasy element to it: The second half of the movie was filled to the brim with Asian folklore creatures and enough whimsy to fill your heart with wonder and awe.If there was anything I’d fault the movie for, it would be the high budget visual effects sort of “deluding” some of the martial arts scenes and maybe a bit too much forced humor. It just feels like every Marvel movie HAS to be a comedy these days, and I hope that trend simmers down in the future.“Shang-Chi” was a pleasant surprise and a HUGE win for the “Marvel Cinematic Universe.” ""Ant-Man,"" I love ya...

Great fight sequences won't make this movie less boring. It really has it's moments but it also sunks into the WTF territory and slow pace of scenes bridging movie acts, makes it hard to watch. Trevor from Iron Man 3 returns as an unfanny companion to the main characters. Marvel took some lessons from Monsterverse movies and this time as a subplot we have two mystical mythological creatures representing chaos and order (or good and evil) entagled in fight against each other. No Shou-Lao or Fing Fang Foom references anywhere. Also... Mandarin is a chicken stew. The most developed character is Shang Chi's father. The worst and out of everything is the Razor Fist, turned into some bulky mindless drone. The story is more straight than Zuckerberg's confused reptilian face, reassembling the plot of LOTR movies... go from point A to B. Overall... not a good flick FOR ME. Also Kevin Feige started damage control weeks ago before the movie premiered, now I know why. "

That can be said about most of the Marvel movies in my opinion, but with recent shows like Loki and WandaVision, I was really hoping the movie would have had more creativity and personality.

61,JoHamm,"Sep 20, 2021",1,0,"I was really excited to see this film based on the incredible movie trailer for it that I saw.  It looked visually stunning and action packed so much that I insisted to my wife that we see this in the theatre.  We have not been out to see a film in the theatre for over 2 years, and I was convinced this would be completely amazing, and had to be seen on the big screen so we went to see it on our wedding anniversary.  I have never been let down by a Marvel film before, so it seemed like the perfect choice to reboot our movie theatre experience.  It started out promising had some great landscape shots and early fight scenes that were awesome but then the next 30-45 minutes or so, all they did was talk and talk back story, more back story and then for absolutely no reason, Ben Kingsley showed up to strangely enough reprise his character from Iron Man 3 - well, I guess the reason is that there would have been no other way to link him to the Marvel universe so they had to throw someone in there and make it seem witty, but I was getting pretty irritated at that point from the lack of any action that was shown jam-packed in the trailer I understand the entire film can’t be wall-to-wall action, but please, don’t bore me to death with over a half hour of these people talking about stuff when they could be DOING stuff as well.  They were just standing around talking about the past and then talked about it some more and then a bunch of lackluster stupid jokes  and THEN I couldn’t take it any longer after the short fight scene with the father in the restaurant during the second half of the film, we got up and walked out after another 10 minutes of complete boredom - and in my entire life, I have only walked out on one other film in the theatre. The editor must have been really attached to some of this footage of everyone standing around talking, cause a good half hour could have been cut out of the film to help the pace move along quite a bit faster.  In all honesty, the film really should be at 2 or 2-1/2 stars, but for some strange reason people are over-glorifying this film like it’s some rare treasure.  Maybe because they blindly follow and put too much faith in Marvel or perhaps because it’s the first true martial arts film in the Marvel universe who truly knows it’s the same as when people tried to defend the horrible 7-8-9 episodes of Star Wars, which were all utter garbage, but people felt compelled to stick with questionable positivity so I in turn felt compelled to give this film a zero to help knock it down to where it should be so nobody else gets fooled walking into it.  If you have seen the trailer already, leave it at that - and just wait until Disney Plus, Netflix or Redbox offers it and have your remote ready with your finger close to the fast forward button, because you are definitely going to need it.

With a title like ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" you would think you would have a pretty good grasp of who Shang-Chi is and what the Ten Rings are. By the time the superfluous post-credits  roll, you know virtually nothing about either of these things. Shang-chi is a bland, boring, cardboard cut-out of a character who knows a little bit of martial arts. The Ten Rings are ten rings that do power stuff and make you immortal. Where do they come from? What is their power? Why do they make you immortal? How did Shang-Chi's father acquire them? All these pivotal questions are unanswered and honestly by the end of the movie, I don't really care anyway. The best action that you would expect from an advertised as ""martial arts movie"" is in the first 30 mins. The bus scene was well done, despite at times coming off as clunky. It just made me want to see more and more impressive fight sequences. With the exception of 2-3 moments not long after, you won't see any more martial arts again. The movie proceeds to drag at a snail's paces for another 1.5 hours. Halfway through the film, for the first time ever, I checked the time to see how much more I had to endure. Shang-Chi's father and sister are confusing. Flip-flopping from wanting family togetherness to loathing everyone in the room with virtually no reason as to why. Best part of this movie was Awkwafina's Katy who was the ONLY character to have some semblance of a ""Hero's Journey"". Shang-Chi was not just a passenger in his own vehicle, he was virtually left behind to blend into the background. With the consistency of Disney/Marvel's subpar offerings beginning with WandaVision onward, I would either wait for this movie to be available for free (if you MUST watch it) or go back and watch the Infinity Saga over again for a much more enjoyable experience. The MCU died with Tony and Steve, it seems at this point like Disney is far too desperate to say goodbye when they had the chance. "

As such, I approachAs an Asian descent, I grew up watching Wu Xia films of all kinds. Tsui Hark, John Woo, and eventually, Zhang Yimou were great influences for me as well as their respective stars, be it Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Donnie Yen.  As such, I approach Shang-Chi with great expectations, especially in lieu of some really glowing reviews. However, what I saw was simply a 'great facsimile' of these great film makers. On one hand, it is so obvious that Disney is really, really pining for the Asian market, especially for the Middle Kingdom.  Mulan, Raya..and now Shang Chi were aggressive plays to get into this market.  However, I can firmly conclude that such efforts backfired. For one, Asian film makers have grown sophisticated and utilized techniques that Hollywood has employed for ages.  And of course, there is a policy by the Middle Kingdom itself: you can display Western movies, but if you make Chinese films made by Westerners and with so called 'Western values', we would look at them with great scrutiny.  Shang-Chi obviously plays more to an Asian American sensibility, of going back to your roots after emigrating to a different country and become a 'foreigner' yourself.  However, it rings hollow to people who have remained in these countries.  And for crying out loud, I have no offense against Simu Liu who seems to be a great guy, but if you are casting Tony Leung as his father, one of the greats of Asian cinema, he is simply outclassed immensely. Kudos for giving what is essentially a comedic relief role to Awkafina, who is a great comedian by the way but in no way a good 'leading lady' for this kind of flick. These factors alone and that sense of being derivative of the so called 'greats' diminished my enjoyment of this film immensely.  Since it is not available 'free' with your Disney plus, it is a pretty good watch.  But in comparison to the great 'Phase 4 shows' available now on the service, Shang Chi is inferior to those efforts. "

This time around the Wenwu villain is much closer to the Mandarin character, but is not the same as in the comics. There is an interesting sub-plot about Wenwu's family, explaining what drives Wenwu to do what he does. Shang-Chi turns out to be a likeable character but Wenwu ultimately disappoints with his stupidity despite his considerable experience. Awkwafina's Katy character alternates between acting as comedy relief and annoying viewers, more often than not doing the latter.The chinese imagery sets this movie apart from any other MCU film, it's like watching films such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" reimagined as a superhero movie. The Shang-Chi character is a martial arts fighter with no superpowers of his own, and the fights are much better than most martial arts movies.But the overall plot is mediocre, uninteresting and unimpactful. There is a second supervillain that acts like a devil, he ought to be scary as 5h!t, but is just another forgettable MCU baddie to be bashed by the heroes like 5 minutes after appearing on-screen for the first time, speaking no words and doing nothing other than stand in the way of the heroes.This film just serves as an introduction of another character to the crowded MCU roster.

I’m really glad this movie exists and we have more diverse characters in the MCU. The Film nails Shang-Chi. Simu Liu gives a great performance and while his motivation isn’t exactly clear, his character is and I like that. It’s good to see that the origin movie does a great job at giving us a somewhat compelling character that I am looking forward to seeing more of. However, all of the other characters aren’t anywhere close to being as good. The performances from most everyone is good with Tony Leung giving a great performance. His villain isn’t great character wise but what I really adored was his villain’s motivation. We finally get a true villain who is motivated by grief and the inability to accept the loss of a loved one. I love that about him and it’s refreshing to see that. The story here is very weak. I didn’t engage with it that much and it was hard to understand the motivations of anyone except the villain. The plot progresses quickly but it’s hard to remember individual story beats because it kinda melds into some of the other MCU films. One thing that does stand out are the visuals and some of the action sequences. Some of the action sequences here were great like the final battle while others felt lackluster. It’s a mixed bag in regards to that. As always, the visuals for this film are great for the most part. There is the occasional weird visual effect but it doesn’t get absolutely horrible. The production design was surprisingly great here. All of the sets look really cool and it’s obvious they spent a lot of time on that. There really isn’t a lot more to say.

Jokes are definitely 'marvelesque' as they tend to become parodies of themselves. The pace is really weird thanks to these numerous flashbacks that respond to each other.

The very end is really underwhelming thanks to the unoriginal and traditional cliff-hanger. The power of the rings is only questioned at the very end, making it unexplained during the whole movie. Fight scenes are great even if repetitive and a bit long. The movie generally focuses way too much on events and plot rather than on relations (excepted between father - mother - Shang-chi - Xialing), which is quite disappointing ; the few we see is poorly written.Despite all this, the music (from 88rising) is absolutely gorgeous even if asian-stereotyped here and there.

The quality of the fights in this movie really depends on what kind it is. If the fight is more martial arts-based, it's incredibly well done and looks spectacular, but if there's any CGI involved it just looks, to put it bluntly, like a mess. The villain is also getting a lot of praise, and while it's definitely good for a Marvel movie. it's essentially just a guy who wants revenge on the people who he thinks kidnapped his wife and he's not all that interesting compared to other villains, even in the Marvel series.

I think it had just the amount of comedic icebreakers without dragging down the dramatic, emotional parts. It's good enough that it doesn't even need the MCU. "

The story wasn't that much better, things just happened and characters were just there in the scenes. Then the randomly changing the dialogue language from English to no idea, maybe Mandarin? Just keep it with one after leaving to China, don't just randomly go from English to Mandarin.I do hope this isn't a glimpse to the future of MCU because it won't last much longer if this level of movie becomes the norm.

94,Player2-Water,"Nov 27, 2021",0,9,"E-Value: 9Acting: 9Plot: 9Similar to 2018’s Black Panther which featured an African superhero, Shang-Chi and the Legends of the Ten Rings features an Asian supehero on the big screen for the twenty-fifth instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Originally slated to release during Chinese New Year, the movie was delayed until now due to COVID-19 pandemic.Xu Shang-Chi (Liu) is a parking valet in San Francisco along with his best friend, Katy Chen (Awkwafina), whom they both lead an easy and carefree life. Shang-Chi’s life got change when he and Katy are attack by members of the Ten Rings where he reveals his fighting skills in the process. However, the Ten Rings are able to grab his emerald pendant which is what they came for all along. With his pendant stolen, Shang-Chi along with Katy travel to a certain place in Macau using the postcard that were sent to him prior.During their travel, Shang-Chi reveal his past to Katy. He is the son of Xu Wenwu (Leung), the real Mandarin, who trained him as an assassin for years and he fled to the San Francisco during one of his mission. When they arrive to their destination, the place turns out to be an illegal underground fighting club run by his sister, Xu Xialing, who also fled from their father. However, she deny sending the postcard to Shang-Chi and they are ambush by the Ten Rings who come for the other emerald pendant in the hands of Xialing. Despite their best efforts, they get capture by the Ten Rings and brought before to their father who wants their emerald pendants for something.Just like Black Panther done with the portrayal of African culture, the movie has done a great job in the portrayal of Asian culture. Asian audience will definitely find it relatable like myself. Even better is Mandarin language was used in 1/3 of the movie to make it feel more of an Asian superhero movie. The casting of Asian actors are very well done and they all gave the best performance. Simu Liu and Tony Leung are the best performers in the whole movie. Their on-screen relationship between father and son are really heartwarming despite their opposing roles and both of their characters are well written. The fighting scenes are very well shot and with this movie being as Asian superhero movie, you will get the feeling that this movie is like a martial arts movie.I also like how the movie made some references to 2013’s Iron Man 3 and how the events in that movie affect this one. This movie also redeem the Mandarin into a better character after the infamous plot twist in that movie. One of the character from that movie, which I will not say who, also appeared in this movie and gets a character developement as well. Although the plot of the movie is like other MCU non-origins solo movies, the story is still interesting and heartwarming at the same time. The story is not complicated to follow but I would recommend to watch Iron Man 3 first to understand about the Mandarin and how it lead into this movie.There is no doubt that is one of best movie in the MCU to date and I hope to see Shang-Chi again on the big screen either in another solo movies or team-up movies. I could say that his movie and future ones will turn Shang-Chi into a household name like Black Panther. Remember to stay back for a mid-credits scene and a post credits scene which is most likely a setup for future movies in the franchise. "

It has to be the most unnecessary character ever. Literally added so that when protagonist is going through a stressful situation we could get a silly shot of Awkwafina showing Shang thumbs up. If you would cut her from the movie nothing would change at all. Not only that but it takes away a much-needed spotlight from Xialing. All those heartfelt conversations that Shang had with Katy he needed to have with his sister instead who had an important role to play in pushing the story forward. Marvel once again proves they’re not able to abandon silly jokes in favor of stronger narrative. "

Been watching a lot of Marvel lately with my partner to help her catch up with the rest of us in the MCU, and this was the most recent piece of the MCU so a little burned out but still had a good time with this one.Visually it is stunning, one of the most beautiful Marvel movies with a lot of interesting stuff to come in the later half.Shang-Chi as a character is all good, he is likable and an absolute badass when it comes to fighting, he just didn't hook me all that much. Didn't feel like he had a whole lot to him that I really latched onto, but not bad either, I look forward to seeing more of him in the MCU so he can be expanded on further. A quick comment about the character Katy but I am not a huge fan of her, a lot of what she says is just cringeworthy jokes that really don't land in my opinion, its not that I didn't like her, I just felt a lot of what she said when it came to the humour side was not landing at all for me.The story I am overall happy with, it is the same type of Marvel Superhero Origin story you'd be accustom too, a coming of age story basically which isn't a bad thing, follows this format because it works, it was just a very easy story to follow and enjoy.The fight scenes were some of the best you will see in a Marvel movie, some long takes that are just so impressive to watch and very limited shaky cam, the choreography is amazing so its great we don't have to deal with cuts in the shot or shaky cam.The music was composed by Joel P West who I had not heard of until after watching this movie, not familiar with his work but I absolutely loved the score to this film, it is easily one of my favourite parts (tied with the visuals and combat).Final thoughts - I mean if you want to keep up with the MCU then you will watch this movie anyway, but I think most people won't have their expectations too high for this one, but will be pleasantly surprised if they decide to watch it.

Another is the over use of CG, I understand it's a great time and money saver but when the sequences are heavily martial arts related it really takes me out of the artistry and choreography seeing 3D models of the actors and stunt performers spliced into scenes and contorting in uncanny valley ways. With that out of the way, it's a solid movie. I've always enjoyed the visual splendour and dramatic movements of wuxia so it's great it'll be seen by a wider audience that have probably had very little exposure to it. High quality practical fight sequences are something that Marvel movies are lacking in (the Netflix Daredevil is amazing) so before this The Winter Soldier scratched the fight itch best. The actors all did a good job on their own and the way they played off each other was enjoyable. "

Living a normal life, his world is turned upside down when the past he has left behind comes back to bite him. Not gonna lie, I wasn't hoping much from this movie considering how disappointing Phase 4 has been but to my surprise, this turned out to be the most entertaining entry in this Post-Infinity Saga so far, particularly because I didn't leave it filled with a layer of disappointment that gets worse the more you think about it. It's not groundbreaking or different from what the MCU has given us before, especially when it comes to origin stories. In fact, it feels very reminiscent of the earlier movies that came in this cinematic universe following a lot of the same formula, part of the reason I enjoyed it as it reminded me of the good ole days where I was genuinely hyped about the MCU and getting introduced to all these superheroes without having any solid comic-book reading history. It's the usual Marvel schtick with a different skin but with good enough execution in certain parts that you get a steady flow of entertainment and hardly any major frustrations, if at all, from the entire 130 mins runtime. What I enjoyed the most was the action sequences, which were predominantly hand-to-hand combat and weaponry based kung-fu. With good choreography and cinematography, fewer cuts, non-shaky cam, and the actors performing a lot of the combat themselves, it was thrilling. The accompanying soundtrack was nice too with a mix of modern and East Asian tracks that flowed well with the action. The story itself, while ending up with the usual end-of-the-world trope that so many superhero flicks have, wasn't bad either. It was cool to see this side of the world in this cinematic universe and not having a typical Human baddie was nice as well. However, the writing was still not particularly good as the movie sorely lacked urgency and stakes. There wasn't that OOOMPH that would have propelled this movie to higher tiers. It played safe and light with a lot of predictable elements so you just sorta experience the events which play out mostly how you'd expect. The dialogue could have been a lot better as well with the same story beats the movie employs and would have given characters a lot more depth where the emotional moments could have been hard-hitting. The titular character himself felt lacking in energy and charisma. I did like the overall ensemble and how it all came together in the end even if full of cliches. I was worried about Awkwafina's character Katie and that she'll be annoying for the rest of the movie but I was pleasantly surprised by her relationship with Shang-Chi played by Simu Lu, it was sweet. I'm glad the humour wasn't in your face throughout and took a backseat at certain points as MCU lately has developed a habit of injecting way too much of their brand of humour and it hasn't worked for me. Not saying the comedy here was great as some of it fell flat on its face but some of it did work. All in all, despite its problems, despite the movie playing it safe, despite it being predictable, I had fun. I do hope Simu Lu gives a stronger performance wherever his character shows up next because compared to other MCU heroes, Shang-Chi himself is among the lower end for me for now. If you like the MCU, then certainly give this a go. If nothing else, you'll probably enjoy the action. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 6.8/10. "

Marvel kiniBaru saja menonton film ini di Disney+ Indonesia, karena tidak sempat menonton di bioskop (tentu saja karena pandemi). Dan yang saya takutkan benar. Film yang menjadi pembuka fase keempat MCU ini benar-benar mengecewakan. Marvel kini benar-benar membuat MCU tidak berkembang, mungkin karena ekspektasi saya terlalu tinggi, tapi saya coba ulangi dengan ekspetasi terendah dan menonton ulang film ini dua kali pun rasanya masih sama: film ini terlalu konyol dan terlalu kartun. Saya ingat, perasaan ini muncul ketika saya melihat film Captain Marvel, meskipun dibintangi oleh aktris pemenang Oscar, tapi ada yang miss dari segi cerita dan gambar. Begitu juga dengan film ini. Beda ketika saya menonton film Eternals. Meskipun durasinya panjang, saya merasa tertarik untuk tetap menonton karena pengenalan cerita, gambar, hingga efek editingnya tidak terlalu over. "

However, the actual movie did not surprise me much. It felt generic, like other action movies, for example, fighting on moving vehicles, the hero got his powerups at the ""exact"" moment when his people needed him. And most of the dialogues were flat, I had trouble getting to know the characters to get to root for them. Maybe that I got my expectation way up high, but whatever, I was in for the fight scene, I got what I came for. Tony Leung's performance is amazing though. "
