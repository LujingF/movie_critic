Overall the fight scenes were the star of the movie and the story was good, I’d definitely recommend it especially if you like good martial arts fight scenes.\n",

The fight choreography and action scenes were impeccable, just so clean and awesome; maybe the best fight choreography I've ever seen and some of the best action scenes ever. The performances from Simu Liu, Meng'er Zhang, Awkwafina, Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, and Ben Kingsley were outstanding. The visual effects were phenomenal from the Great Protector to the Shishi to the Dweller-in-Darkness, just some of the best visual effects I've ever seen. The writing was stupendous, the screenplay and story were just superb and the character development especially with Shang-Chi was terrific. The costumes were spectacular.

Also it corrects one of the mayor disappointments from a previous movie with a satisfying explanation and turns it into a strength. Lets start at the beginning. Since Marvel phase 4 started you hear a lot of people say that the movies are in or will decline. This movie is the counter argument. It is refreshing, entertaining and introduces new characters I want to see more of. It was also the kind of martial arts movie my friends and I missed in recent years. The story starts with a flashback thousand (or thousands?) years ago where Wenwu finds the ten rings which gave him eternal youth and so much power that he can be considered to be a god among humans. He creates the ten rings organization and becomes a really powerful ruler but operates mostly in the shadows. However his hunger for power is never satisfied. After he hears the legend of the hidden village Ta Lo where the inhabitants have mystical power he is determined to acquire this power for himself. However he will get something different and far more precious than he could have imagined. In the present Shaun works with his best friend Kathy as car valets when their lives are changed forever. I stop here with the story set up to avoid spoilers. The story itself is extremely good for an introduction movie. It gets the small and big things right. Main key elements are family, heritage, loss, finding your way or purpose in life and dealing with the past. They manage to mix the story with the characters in a way that one enhance the other. Lets continue with the characters: Simu Liu as Shaun is a great main actor. He delivers every aspect of his character and should be praised. Then we have Awkwafina as Kathy who steals the show in many scenes and is jut amazingly good. Those two together are a force to be recognized. Tony Leug is a legendary actor and his performance as Xu Wenwu is excellent. This is also valid for Michelle Yeoh. Ben Kingsley is the hidden gem of the movie and so enjoyable. Meng’er Zhang as Xu Xialing and Fala Chen as Ying Li deliver a good performance and won us easily over. Special praise to the right hand men Ronny Chieng as Jon Jon and Florian Munteanu as Razor Fist. I almost forgot Benedict Wong. Small screentime but amazing performance. The cast is fantastic and I wont replace anyone. The fights are amazing too. The first one alone should win you over with ease. The choreography is excellent and the camera works well to enhanced it while avoiding all the mistakes other movies make. Many modern movies fail with shaky camera, poor zooming (to close, bad angles, to far away or bad lighting) and uninspired ideas. Here they shine in many fights. The special effects are excellent as required per Marvel standard. Was and is never and issue. The sets and practical effects look beautiful and create an immersive atmosphere. Lastly I want to praise the humor. There are a lot of good scenes and especially a post credit scene is a must watch. Overall this was much better than expected and I heard good things about the movie before watching it. It slightly misses a 10/10 for me but is definitely a must see.</span><span class=\"blurb_etc\">…</span> <span class=\"toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand\">Expand</span></span>\n",

      "<span class=\"blurb blurb_expanded\">It has well choreographed fights, lovable characters and a good story garnered with humor. Also it corrects one of the mayor disappointments from a previous movie with a satisfying explanation and turns it into a strength. Lets start at the beginning. Since Marvel phase 4 started you hear a lot of people say that the movies are in or will decline. This movie is the counter argument. It is refreshing, entertaining and introduces new characters I want to see more of. It was also the kind of martial arts movie my friends and I missed in recent years. The story starts with a flashback thousand (or thousands?) years ago where Wenwu finds the ten rings which gave him eternal youth and so much power that he can be considered to be a god among humans. He creates the ten rings organization and becomes a really powerful ruler but operates mostly in the shadows. However his hunger for power is never satisfied. After he hears the legend of the hidden village Ta Lo where the inhabitants have mystical power he is determined to acquire this power for himself. However he will get something different and far more precious than he could have imagined. In the present Shaun works with his best friend Kathy as car valets when their lives are changed forever. I stop here with the story set up to avoid spoilers. The story itself is extremely good for an introduction movie. It gets the small and big things right. Main key elements are family, heritage, loss, finding your way or purpose in life and dealing with the past. They manage to mix the story with the characters in a way that one enhance the other. Lets continue with the characters: Simu Liu as Shaun is a great main actor. He delivers every aspect of his character and should be praised. Then we have Awkwafina as Kathy who steals the show in many scenes and is jut amazingly good. Those two together are a force to be recognized. Tony Leug is a legendary actor and his performance as Xu Wenwu is excellent. This is also valid for Michelle Yeoh. Ben Kingsley is the hidden gem of the movie and so enjoyable. Meng’er Zhang as Xu Xialing and Fala Chen as Ying Li deliver a good performance and won us easily over. Special praise to the right hand men Ronny Chieng as Jon Jon and Florian Munteanu as Razor Fist. I almost forgot Benedict Wong. Small screentime but amazing performance. The cast is fantastic and I wont replace anyone. The fights are amazing too. The first one alone should win you over with ease. The choreography is excellent and the camera works well to enhanced it while avoiding all the mistakes other movies make. Many modern movies fail with shaky camera, poor zooming (to close, bad angles, to far away or bad lighting) and uninspired ideas. Here they shine in many fights. The special effects are excellent as required per Marvel standard. Was and is never and issue. The sets and practical effects look beautiful and create an immersive atmosphere. Lastly I want to praise the humor. There are a lot of good scenes and especially a post credit scene is a must watch. Overall this was much better than expected and I heard good things about the movie before watching it. It slightly misses a 10/10 for me but is definitely a must see.</span>\n",

While the trailer appeared to bill this as little more than a grandiose martial arts movie, director Destin Daniel Cretton's latest has an epic quality about it, presenting a story that's mythic in nature and infused with themes related to morality, personal evolution and coming into one's own, qualities not often found in releases like this. The picture is essentially an origin story piece in the same vein as \"Captain Marvel\" and \"Black Panther,\" with a narrative that mirrors both of these cinematic predecessors but with better overall execution, especially in the writing and pacing. Besides its captivating story and well-orchestrated (though generally not overdone) action sequences, this offering features ample comic relief, unexpected touches of whimsy and surprisingly good performances, especially from Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh and Ben Kingsley. While the film's closing act is admittedly a little too drawn out, that's a small price to pay for everything else it has to offer. \"Shang-chi\" is easily one of the best films of the summer season and one of the finest additions to the Marvel Universe to come along in quite some time. Action-adventure fans will surely enjoy it, but even those generally less drawn to this genre will likely come away from this one having had a good, uplifting and entertaining time.</span><span class=\"blurb_etc\">…</span> <span class=\"toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand\">Expand</span></span>\n",

It is the first MCU theatrical release with a predominantly Asian cast. While it surely fits into the overall expanded universe, I can't tell you how it fits into whatever phase this is, but it is essentially Shang-Chi's origin story and, in that sense, it kind of can stand alone. The question is whether its worth trekking to the theater for all the action and drama - here's how we see it.<br/><br/>Shang-Chi also known as \"Shaun\" (Simu Liu) has been an unassuming valet for years paling around with his best friend, Katy (Awkwafina) in San Francisco. On one fateful day as Shang-Chi and Katy are on their way to work, they get attacked by a group of thugs from the Ten Rings led by the goon, Razor Fist. Shang-Chi fends off the attackers in an impressive action sequence, but he exposes what he had otherwise hidden from Katy - kung-fu prowess and a history connected to those men that attacked him. From there, Shang-Chi and Katy set out on a quest to confront his past, protect his sister, and defeat his diabolical father who has had overwhelming power for a thousand years thanks to the titular Ten Rings.<br/><br/>For most of these MCU films, what are we really looking for? Action. Comedy. Spectacle. A tie-in to the expanded universe. Shang-Chi delivers on most of that.<br/><br/>Action - as a newcomer to the MCU, Simu Liu does a good job of setting up who Shang-Chi is and how he might fit into the larger group. The early fight sequences are exciting primarily because of Liu's athletic abilities. The kinetic energy brought to those set pieces are good enough to jolt some awake. Also, there is a fight between Tony Leung and Fala Chen early on that is a must see - it is quite awe-inspiring. When it comes to the MCU, the climactic battles are usually a mish-mosh and over-the-top, fortunately, this one is no different.<br/><br/>Comedy - Liu also has good chemistry with Awkwafina - although the comedy is a bit lacking considering Awkwafina's reputation. There were not really any laugh out loud moments, but the easy tone of the film overall makes it generally enjoyable. It feels like they were trying for it, but it didn't hit the mark.<br/><br/>Spectacle - the special effects here are pretty good. The power of the Ten Rings is interesting and the way they work into the action sequences works really well. The production design of Ta Lo is really beautiful to look at. Of course, Marvel Studios used their Marvel money to make the setting stand out. I can't say it is Black Panther impressive, but it was good nonetheless.<br/><br/>In some ways, the movie gets a bit too stereotypical with Asian folks and dragons and never aging and then turning into dragons. There also is a tinge of this movie hearkening too close to Mulan in look and feel as if Disney was like we have some content we can save money on for this. Either way, I'm glad that Disney has opened minds to diversity with their live action films. Let's keep it up!<br/><br/>Long story short, Marvel doesn't really make missteps and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is no different. The movie is a bit too long and Simu Liu might not have found his comedic legs yet. And still the movie is stereotypically enjoyable and well done by the MCU. I wonder how this will fit into the next phases of Marvel but until then I'll pick up a big box of popcorn as I ponder.</span><span class=\"blurb_etc\">…</span> <span class=\"toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand\">Expand</span></span>\n",

It is the first MCU theatrical release with a predominantly Asian cast. While it surely fits into the overall expanded universe, I can't tell you how it fits into whatever phase this is, but it is essentially Shang-Chi's origin story and, in that sense, it kind of can stand alone. The question is whether its worth trekking to the theater for all the action and drama - here's how we see it.<br/><br/>Shang-Chi also known as \"Shaun\" (Simu Liu) has been an unassuming valet for years paling around with his best friend, Katy (Awkwafina) in San Francisco. On one fateful day as Shang-Chi and Katy are on their way to work, they get attacked by a group of thugs from the Ten Rings led by the goon, Razor Fist. Shang-Chi fends off the attackers in an impressive action sequence, but he exposes what he had otherwise hidden from Katy - kung-fu prowess and a history connected to those men that attacked him. From there, Shang-Chi and Katy set out on a quest to confront his past, protect his sister, and defeat his diabolical father who has had overwhelming power for a thousand years thanks to the titular Ten Rings.<br/><br/>For most of these MCU films, what are we really looking for? Action. Comedy. Spectacle. A tie-in to the expanded universe. Shang-Chi delivers on most of that.<br/><br/>Action - as a newcomer to the MCU, Simu Liu does a good job of setting up who Shang-Chi is and how he might fit into the larger group.

What we really care about is the action and this features some of the most beautifully choreographed fight sequences in the genre, primarily because of the focus on traditional martial arts techniques. The scenes on the bus and the skyscraper scaffolding are the highlights. Only the final dragon confrontation resorts to the typical CGI encounters. The other crucial aspect to making a superhero flick stand out is creating cool new visual approaches and there are several scenes that thrill the imagination.

An exemplar with which we were not familiar that, not only knew how to exploit their low expectations to the maximum extent, but also developed a structured and dynamic narrative immersed in a MCU that does not leave much room for new heroes.<br/>Shang-Chi made its first appearance in Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin's “Special Marvel Edition # 15” (December 1973). A Kung-Fu master created in the middle of the genre's boom in the US in the 1970s, Shang-Chi is quite a quirky character.<br/>Played by Simu Liu, the protagonist is embarked on an adventure after being intercepted by ghosts from his past. Full of action, martial arts and a very own and attractive aesthetic, the film unfolds without delay. The scenes are punctual and always add something new. Even with a sense of  humor that can get heavy on certain occasions (such as when Katy makes jokes in the middle of life and death situations), Shang-Chi finds its essence, exploits it and ends with a gold ribbon leaving the door open for future aftermath.<br/>Marvel and its production team never cease to amaze me with their new films. In a difficult transition period, given the conclusion of the Infinity Saga and the beginning of this new phase, the studio keeps its feet on the ground and continues a coherent thread of its interconnected universe. Regardless of the obvious mentions to the events of \"Avengers Endgame\", Marvel returns to do what it does best: including thousands of references, cameos and winks that leave the geeks like me open-mouthed and with the greed for more.<br/>The cast is incredible. I did not know any of the actors beforehand and they all dazzled me with their distinctive personalities and professional interpretations. The studio made a great work in synthetizing the oriental culture´s mythology and beliefs. However, it is true that Shang-Chi continues to be a westernized vision of Asian cultures due to its falls into stereotypes of martial arts and frequent characterizations of the Eastern world in Hollywood. Despite this and to my surprise, Shang-Chi knows how to combine the best of both worlds, using humor as its best tool and taking its time to tell the story, avoiding the rush to get to the action sequences that movies of this kind have suffered<br/>The protagonist's arc is round and fulfilling. It has cohesion and is true to its ideals from beginning to end. Thus, the villain (excellently played by Tony Leung) only contributes to the plot and does not fall into the corner of un-memorable Marvel villains. We send you a greeting, Fake Mandarin. If it hadn't been for the blessing acting skills of RDJ, no one would remember your existence.<br/>Furthermore, the film interprets the concept of \"grays\" very well. In a franchise that is \"infantilized\" at times, Shang-Chi does not stutter in telling the hard truths of reality such as unsatisfactory employment, unreal family expectations, childhood trauma, the dilemma about murder, among others. Heroes are not pure white. They have their shortcomings, they fight with their demons and that makes them more credible, more human.<br/>With a stellar sound-track, Shang-Chi is one of Marvel's most unexpected gems. It is amazing to feel and denote the love with which these films are made and the fidelity to the source materials. For example, the main character's leitmotif is a work of art and a composition that immerses us even more in the plot. Kevin Feige deserves all the praise, he is truly a man who knows how to sell his product very well and, at the same time, sell us something with great qualitative value.<br/>After the post-credits scenes, fans only crave more and rejoice in the near future for what remains of this phase. Now with the recent release of the trailer for the new Spiderman movie, one only has to cross out the days for its premiere and admire the attention to detail that they put into the making of the films, not only as individual creations, but as a large adjoining and a special set of films.

A Kung-Fu master created in the middle of the genre's boom in the US in the 1970s, Shang-Chi is quite a quirky character.<br/>Played by Simu Liu, the protagonist is embarked on an adventure after being intercepted by ghosts from his past. Full of action, martial arts and a very own and attractive aesthetic, the film unfolds without delay. The scenes are punctual and always add something new. Even with a sense of  humor that can get heavy on certain occasions (such as when Katy makes jokes in the middle of life and death situations), Shang-Chi finds its essence, exploits it and ends with a gold ribbon leaving the door open for future aftermath.<br/>Marvel and its production team never cease to amaze me with their new films. In a difficult transition period, given the conclusion of the Infinity Saga and the beginning of this new phase, the studio keeps its feet on the ground and continues a coherent thread of its interconnected universe. Regardless of the obvious mentions to the events of \"Avengers Endgame\", Marvel returns to do what it does best: including thousands of references, cameos and winks that leave the geeks like me open-mouthed and with the greed for more.<br/>The cast is incredible. I did not know any of the actors beforehand and they all dazzled me with their distinctive personalities and professional interpretations. The studio made a great work in synthetizing the oriental culture´s mythology and beliefs. However, it is true that Shang-Chi continues to be a westernized vision of Asian cultures due to its falls into stereotypes of martial arts and frequent characterizations of the Eastern world in Hollywood. Despite this and to my surprise, Shang-Chi knows how to combine the best of both worlds, using humor as its best tool and taking its time to tell the story, avoiding the rush to get to the action sequences that movies of this kind have suffered<br/>The protagonist's arc is round and fulfilling. It has cohesion and is true to its ideals from beginning to end. Thus, the villain (excellently played by Tony Leung) only contributes to the plot and does not fall into the corner of un-memorable Marvel villains. We send you a greeting, Fake Mandarin. If it hadn't been for the blessing acting skills of RDJ, no one would remember your existence.<br/>Furthermore, the film interprets the concept of \"grays\" very well. In a franchise that is \"infantilized\" at times, Shang-Chi does not stutter in telling the hard truths of reality such as unsatisfactory employment, unreal family expectations, childhood trauma, the dilemma about murder, among others. Heroes are not pure white. They have their shortcomings, they fight with their demons and that makes them more credible, more human.<br/>With a stellar sound-track, Shang-Chi is one of Marvel's most unexpected gems. It is amazing to feel and denote the love with which these films are made and the fidelity to the source materials. For example, the main character's leitmotif is a work of art and a composition that immerses us even more in the plot. Kevin Feige deserves all the praise, he is truly a man who knows how to sell his product very well and, at the same time, sell us something with great qualitative value.<br/>After the post-credits scenes, fans only crave more and rejoice in the near future for what remains of this phase. Now with the recent release of the trailer for the new Spiderman movie, one only has to cross out the days for its premiere and admire the attention to detail that they put into the making of the films, not only as individual creations, but as a large adjoining and a special set of films. Bravo Marvel.<br/>Postscript: I really love Benedict Wong. Is he the ultimate man?</span>\n",

Guided to craft beautifully by Destin Daniel Cretton. Shang-Chi has a massive soulfulness that future MCU movies need to take notes on and that only Black Panther did so memorably. It occurred to me while watching this movie that it is genuinely no longer about the characters we focus on, but it is their adventure toward locating themselves, and we follow that adventure here in an amazing Superhero Oriental Fantasy blockbuster. Noticeably, the VFX, scene sets, costume designs, and the special effects themselves incredibly heightened the impact of the movie and allowed a symbolic impact on the awe-inspiring production value and, as a result, the aforementioned movie knocked out in dazzling heights on a beautiful scale because of the VFX. The movement sequences and choreography are polished and stunning. Narratively, the storyline continues incredibly, and we understand the moments of humour the MCU is so well-known for, and we are all here for it. This film divided me going to the cinema and waiting for a digital component! Because of COVID-19, however, I didn’t need to have the entirety of Shang-Chi spoiled earlier on with leaks, thank goodness I went to the very first showing on the opening Thursday night, I have experienced Shang-Chi several times now and in extraordinarily different formats including 4D-X. This movie displays some of the most remarkably phenomenal combat performances in a Marvel movie I had never seen in this noticeable approach previously. The movie is formulaic and well-trodden territory for Marvel and has several exceptional visual effects layered in. Shang-Chi is such an enchanting movie to watch and even better on the biggest screen you can find, keeping safety in mind at all times! If you have seen Marvel movies consistently, you’ve got to know that the narrative is a predictable storyline for Marvel’s superhero foundation adventures. This film is full of numerous great moments, with its battle sequences and action set pieces, which is arguably undoubtedly its major attraction. But Shang-Chi has given us some outstanding personalities and characters in a live-action film like Black Panther’s did so on his solitary quest. Marvel Studios’ Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the most exceptional superhero movies I’ve watched in years, if not in the past decade. Simu Liu and Meng’er Zhang and Tony Leung Chiu Wai get considerable distinct and exceptional choreographed action choreography that we have not witnessed since Captain America: Winter Soldier. There is not any one thing like Shang-Chi I have seen before in the MCU, this film seems fresh. Shang-Chi feeds us with the deprived traditional antique sequences of martial craftsmanship, which we appreciate a lot as an audience and applauds in an incredible modern depiction. This is one of the better, exceptional Marvel films ever. I would recommend watching this one.</span><span class=\"blurb_etc\">…</span> <span class=\"toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand\">Expand</span></span>\n",

Guided to craft beautifully by Destin Daniel Cretton. Shang-Chi has a massive soulfulness that future MCU movies need to take notes on and that only Black Panther did so memorably. It occurred to me while watching this movie that it is genuinely no longer about the characters we focus on, but it is their adventure toward locating themselves, and we follow that adventure here in an amazing Superhero Oriental Fantasy blockbuster. Noticeably, the VFX, scene sets, costume designs, and the special effects themselves incredibly heightened the impact of the movie and allowed a symbolic impact on the awe-inspiring production value and, as a result, the aforementioned movie knocked out in dazzling heights on a beautiful scale because of the VFX. The movement sequences and choreography are polished and stunning. Narratively, the storyline continues incredibly, and we understand the moments of humour the MCU is so well-known for, and we are all here for it. This film divided me going to the cinema and waiting for a digital component! Because of COVID-19, however, I didn’t need to have the entirety of Shang-Chi spoiled earlier on with leaks, thank goodness I went to the very first showing on the opening Thursday night, I have experienced Shang-Chi several times now and in extraordinarily different formats including 4D-X. This movie displays some of the most remarkably phenomenal combat performances in a Marvel movie I had never seen in this noticeable approach previously. The movie is formulaic and well-trodden territory for Marvel and has several exceptional visual effects layered in. Shang-Chi is such an enchanting movie to watch and even better on the biggest screen you can find, keeping safety in mind at all times! If you have seen Marvel movies consistently, you’ve got to know that the narrative is a predictable storyline for Marvel’s superhero foundation adventures. This film is full of numerous great moments, with its battle sequences and action set pieces, which is arguably undoubtedly its major attraction. But Shang-Chi has given us some outstanding personalities and characters in a live-action film like Black Panther’s did so on his solitary quest. Marvel Studios’ Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the most exceptional superhero movies I’ve watched in years, if not in the past decade. Simu Liu and Meng’er Zhang and Tony Leung Chiu Wai get considerable distinct and exceptional choreographed action choreography that we have not witnessed since Captain America: Winter Soldier. There is not any one thing like Shang-Chi I have seen before in the MCU, this film seems fresh. Shang-Chi feeds us with the deprived traditional antique sequences of martial craftsmanship, which we appreciate a lot as an audience and applauds in an incredible modern depiction. This is one of the better, exceptional Marvel films ever. I would recommend watching this one.</span><span class=\"blurb_etc\">…</span> <span class=\"toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand\">Expand</span></span>\n",
